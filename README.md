# Remote-Network-Management-Using-VPN-Technologies

This project implements a VPN-based remote network management solution that securely enables remote access to organizational networks. It addresses security risks such as Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks by using encryption, authentication, and secure tunneling to protect remote administration while supporting scalable and flexible business operations.

## Key Features
- Secure remote access using VPN technology
- Encrypted communication to replace insecure Telnet access
- Protection against MitM and traffic interception attacks
- Scalable design suitable for enterprise networks

## Technologies Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- VPN (IPsec)
- AES Encryption & SHA Hashing
- NAT and Static Routing
- Cisco IOS (CLI)

## What Was Implemented
- Multi-branch network connected through an internet router
- Encrypted VPN tunnel between remote and main branches
- Secure authentication for remote users
- Connectivity and security validation using ping and traceroute

## Outcome
- Successful secure remote management across network branches
- Encrypted and authenticated remote access
- Enterprise-ready and extendable network design
